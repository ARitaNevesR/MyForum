# 💬 MyForum (Node.js + Express)
This project is a basic forum-style web application developed using Node.js and express, designed to explore core web functionalities without the use of a database.

🛠️ Main Features:
• User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
• Post creation and editing
• Public and private posts
• Commenting system
• Editable .txt content within posts
• Real-time chat between users (basic implementation)

📌 This was my first project using Node.js and Express, so it’s a learning experience; expect some rough edges and experimental code. Data is stored using file-based methods instead of a database.
